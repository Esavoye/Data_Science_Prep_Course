Im also not big on ordering pasta when I go out. Alas, I was outnumbered. Thank goodness! I ordered the sea bass special. It was to die for. Cooked perfectly, seasoned perfectly, perfect portion. I can not say enough good things about this dish. When the server asked how it was he seemed very proud of the dish and said, \" doesn\\'t she (the chef) do an incredible job?\" She does. \\n\\nMy hubby got the crab tortellini and also loved his. I heard \"mmmm this is so good\" from all around the table. Our waiter was super nice and even gave us free desserts because we were some of the last people in the restaurant. Service was very slow and the place was PACKED but we had our jugs of wine and a large group with good conversation so it didn\\'t seem to bother anyone.\\n\\nSo-\\n\\nDo order the calamari and fried zucchini appetizers. Leave out the mussels. \\n\\nIf they have the sea bass special, I highly recommend it. The chicken parm and crab tortellini were also very good and very big. The chicken Romano was a bit bland. The house salads were teeny. \\n\\nDo make a reservation but still expect to wait for your food. Go with a large group of people and plan for it to be loud. Don\\'t go with a date unless you\\'re fighting and don\\'t feel like hearing anything they have to say.  Ask to sit in the side room if it\\'s available.'"

       "\"Wow. So surprised at the one and two star reviews!  We started with the most tender calamari. Although the marinara sauce was a bit bland, but a touch of salt made it just right. My husband had the veal with peppers and said it was so delicious and tender. The mashed potatoes were perfect. I had the salmon Diablo which was also delicious. Our salad was beautiful! Dressing was served on the salad and it was a nice amount. We ended our delicious meal with a piece of tiramisu. Our server Matt was right on!! Very pleasant and knowledgeable about the menu. Our appetizer, salad and entrees were timed perfectly. I love salad and did not mind that my entree was served while I was still eating it! No problem it let my dinner cool to just the right temp for me to eat it comfortably. \\nI wonder sometimes if people just don't appreciate relaxing and taking time to eat a wonderful and beautifully prepared meal.  A wonderful atmosphere. So relaxing. The chairs are super comfortable too!!! We will certainly be back. \\nGive it a try.  Don't  always go by the reviews. \\nA bottle of Riesling, calamari app, two delicious entrees and dessert for $92! \\nWell with it.\""

A great way to get a visual look at how frequently certain words occur is by a wordcloud. A nice introduction to creating wordclouds is [here](https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/wordcloud-python) in a DataCamp community article. You'll likely want to pay attention to the step for installing the relevant library in order to get the next import statement to work."

Then you've used knowledge gained from that to extract just the related reviews from a large file that, otherwise, would be too large to handle. You've further teased apart the best and the worst reviews to look at them separately and clearly seen there is a difference.\n",

    "The use of single words is a good start, but words occur in sequences and sequences can have much additional meaning. Consider a good review that said \"Highly recommended\" and a bad review that said \"Not recommended\". Analysing just single words, we would lose the \"highly recommended\" tag. What's more, with the approach of looking for words in good reviews that aren't in bad reviews, we would lose the word \"recommended\" entirely. Using sequences of two words, or bi-grams as they're known, would tackle this issue. Generally, in fact, we can consider n-grams."
